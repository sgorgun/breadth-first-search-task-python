# Breadth-first search

## Purpose

The coding exercises are designed to test knowledge of the following concepts:

* The Breadth-first search approach for graph traversal

## Overview

The coding exercises cover the following practical problems:
* Calculating the number of connectivity components in a given undirected graph
* Checking whether a given directed graph has any cycles
* Finding all distances from a given graph vertex to other vertices
