# Breadth-first search

Set of programming assignments that are designed to test knowledge of BFS (breadth-first search), one of the graph traversal methods.


## Problem 1: Calculate the number of connectivity components in an undirected graph

Your first programming assignment is to implement BFS in order to calculate the number of connectivity components. Vertices are enumerated from 0 to N-1, there N is the input number and equals to number of vertices. The second input parameter is an adjacency dictionary.

## Problem 2: Check if a graph has cycle in an undirected graph

Your task is to implement BFS in order to find whether or not at least one cycle is presented in the given graph. Vertices are enumerated from 0 to N-1, there N is the input number and equals to the number of vertices. The second input parameter is an adjacency dictionary.


## Problem 3: Find all distances from the given vertex to all vertices in an undirected graph
Given an N (number of graph vertices, which are numerated from 0 to N-1), adjacency dictionary and starting vertex, your task is to return distance list, which reflects the distance between starting vertex and vertex I, results for vertex I should be placed at index I. If there is no path from the initial vertex to vertex I, you should put -1 to index I.
